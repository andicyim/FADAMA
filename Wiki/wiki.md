# FADAMA User Tutorial

The ***forensic anthropology database for assessing methods accuracy (FADAMA)*** is an online forensic case database for documenting forensic anthropology methods and case outcomes. The main purpose of this database is to create avenues for forensic anthropology methods development and improvement by providing detailed data on method use, method outcomes, and individual and cumulative method accuracy. FADAMA serves as a repository for forensic anthropologists with past and/or present positively identified cases. All data submitted by practitioners is then amalgamated into a single database, which can be easily searched and downloaded for research purposes by FADAMA users.
